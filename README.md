## Simple Arduino Serial Demo

I put this together quickly to demo a simple HTML5 C++ GUI, Arduinio serial communication, and useing the Arduino to control a motor with a PWM wave.

### Compile
make

### Use
./server

This defaults to localhost:8080 and is hardcoded with /dev/ACM0 for the address of the Arduino.

A video is on my youtube page.
